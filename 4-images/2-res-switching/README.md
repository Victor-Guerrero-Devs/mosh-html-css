## About 

Unlike image density, resolution switching deals with changing the physical size of an image 
in relation to the viewport width. 
- example: if the user is using a mobile phone, your image is 200px wide. if the user is using desktop, 
your image is 600px wide. 

Image density depends on DPR, i.e. the amount of pixels that the device can display. 
- as seen before, the image does not change actual size.

Resolution switching depends on the actual viewport width, i.e. is it being viewed on a mobile, tablet, desktop? 

Images will naturally be smaller on mobile rather than on desktop, e.g. 300px wide on mobile but 900px on desktop.
