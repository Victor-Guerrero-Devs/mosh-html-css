## About 

Unlike image density, resolution switching deals with changing the physical size of an image 
in relation to the viewport width. 

Image density depends on DPR, i.e. the amount of pixels that the device can display. 

Resolution switching depends on the viewport width, i.e. is it being viewed on a mobile, tablet, desktop? 

Images will naturally be smaller on mobile rather than on desktop, e.g. 300px wide on mobile but 900px on desktop.
