        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          IN the last lesson, we learned how we can support high density screens
          by using images with higher pixel counts, so the image won't look
          elongated and pixelated on screens with high DPR.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is another problem, on top of providing high res images for
          screens with high DPR, we also have to provide different image sizes
          for different devices, i.e. a 300x300 image for mobile, 600x600 for
          tablets, 1200x1200 for desktops.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the last lesson, no matter the resolution of the image, it was
          limited to 400 pixels in width. This time, we want to change the
          actual width so the image becomes physically smaller or larger
          depending on the device.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since there way too many devices and differences between them, we
          should only provide three kinds of images for resolution switching:
          small for mobile, medium for tablet, and large for desktop.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How To Implement</h2>
        <p>
          Like in the last section, we use the srcset attribute in the image
          element but with a slight modification.
        </p>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/srcsetex.png" alt="" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          Instead of using 1x, 2x, 3x, we give the actual number for its width
          in pixels, hence 400w, 800w, 1200w. Be careful though since you may
          use "px" instead of "w".
        </p>

        <p>
          The browser will know which image to use in relation to the device's
          viewport. Therefore, if the user is visiting your site on a mobile
          device, the browser will know to pick the image that has
          <strong>400w</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice how the image has the class cow? Well, instead of limiting the
          width of the image to 400px, we make sure it fills its container by
          using <strong>.cow { width: 100%; } </strong> in this way, the image
          becomes responsive.
        </p>
        <p>This is the most basic way to use resolution switching.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Advanced Usage of Resolution Switching</h2>
        <p>
          So far, we have implemented basic resolution switching. IN other
          words, our image takes up 100% of its container's width no matter if
          it is on mobile or tablet or desktop, while changing physical size 
          in relation to device.
        </p>

        <p>
          Advanced resolution switching, controls how much of the viewport width
          it takes up, e.g. 100% for mobile, 50% for tablet, 33% for desktop.
        </p>

        <p>
          IN order to do this, we get rid
          <strong>.cow { width: 100%; } </strong> and use the attribute called
          sizes as so:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/ex2.png" alt="" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          To reword what sizes is doing: if the viewport width is maximum 500px
          (i.e. mobile), have the image take up 100% of the vw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Else, if the viewport width is maximum 700px (i.e. tablet), have the
          image take up 50% of the vw.
        </p>

        <p>Otherwise, have the image take up 33% of the vw.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The numbers used in both the srcset and sizes attributes are completly
          arbitrary. You can play around with them and use more or less than 3
          different sizes.

            A couple of tips for using this website: 
            <ul>
                <li>Resolution 200 - 1400 covers the majority of devices </li>
                <li>Size step determines the difference in file size per image (50kb is ideal)</li>
                <li>Reduce maximum images to 3 or 5. 20 is way too much. </li>
            </ul>
