        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes, you want to use a cropped or zoomed in version of an image
          if the user is on a mobile or tablet device. However, if the user is
          on a desktop, you give the full sized image instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          To check out a live example of this, go to this resturant's website
          <a href="https://earls.ca/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/deskex.png" alt="" width="80%" />
          <figcaption>Desktop Version</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/mobilex.png" alt="" width="60%" />
          <figcaption>Mobile/Tablet Version</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>
          Notice how in the desktop version, each image has its own column and
          they are all the same size. On the mobile/tablet version, however, the
          first image is made twice as large as the other two, zoomed in, and
          given its own row. The other two images share the same row but given
          their own columns.

        <h2>When To Use Art Direction</h2>
        <p>
          There are two main reasons to use this:
          <ol>
              <li>For photo galleries</li>
              <li>For background images</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            To expand on the first one, as you saw in the restaurant's webpage, you may want to 
            have your mobile users to get more appetizing, zoomed in photos of your food. 
            In general, you want to give mobile and tablet users a more zoomed in and cropped 
            image for best practice. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For the second reason, just like the first, you should use a zoomed in background image 
            for mobile and tablet users because it looks better. 
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>How To Use Art Direction</h2>
          <p>
              For this example, download a full sized image and then scale it to 400px and save it 
              as img.jpg 
          </p>

          <p>
            Then take that image and either crop it or zoom in on it and save it as img-cropped.jpg or 
            img-zoomed.jpg
          </p>

          <p>
              Finally use the picture element and nest source elements in it with these attributes and 
              values.
          </p>

          <figure>
              <img src="./images/picex.png" alt="">
          </figure>

          <p>
              The first source element is saying: if the device's width is less than 500, use this 
              zoomed in image 
          </p>
          <p>
              The second source element is saying: else, if the device's width is larger than 
              501px, use this 2x image 
          </p>

          <p>
              Finally, the last img element without a source is the default. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Having classes is not necessary but I had to add them so the image wouldn't overflow 
              out of its container, <strong>.fox { width: 50%; } </strong>
          </p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
              Once again, no need to go overboard with implementing this. Just stick to using it for 
              important images on the home/landing page. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Also the width in the examples (500, 501) are arbitrary. Use whichever values 
              suit your design. 
          </p>
          <p>
              To practice, make a mock menu with photos that change in relation to viewing it on 
              desktops, tablets or mobiles. Since we only used two source elements, one for mobile and 
              another one for both tablet/desktop, use a source for each one (therefore 3)
