          imgs/forest-road.jpg    1x,
          imgs/forest-road@2x.jpg 2x,

        Certain displays like the ones on iPhones and iMacs and highend androids
        have a very high pixel density. In order to not have blurry pictures on
        these, we have to provide the same image in different resolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the most, this is only done for very important images like the hero
        image and we provide 3 different versions: one for regular screens
        (400x400, aka @1x), one for 2 DPR (800x800, aka @2x) and one for 3 DPR
        (1200x1200, aka @3x) which applies to the latest generation of iphones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we get these three different resolutions, we should compress via an
        online tool. After this is done, we use the
        <code>srcset</code> attribute in the <code>img</code> element to set the
        3 different kinds of photos we want to use at X resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original <code>src</code> attribute should have the @1x resolution
        picture. It must also have a CSS class that is limited to
        <code>400px</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other two high res versions will also be limited to 400px but you
        may change (realistically, you would lower it to accomadate the smaller
        viewport)
